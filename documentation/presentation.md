## Staged Development

In parallel with working on fetching information from the APIs and making a working server, versions of the website were made with some copied details from the APIs, representing just a few artists. That way any useful HTML and CSS could be learned, and visuals and the user interface could be explored and details decided on. Later on, the copied API details could be stripped out and replaced with template tags, with the HTML and CSS formatting remaining to create a template for the Go server.

## Visual Transitions

We had seen some other examples of Groupie Tracker websites, and noticed that the images often looked nicer as circles. In the process of learning what could be done to change the square shape of the JPEG files into circles or perhaps other shapes, we were also thinking about how to display more information after interacting with an artist image, and there were some appropriate ideas we could adapt from the How TO section of the w3schools.com website. Initially, we were all thinking of popups to present more information, but the flip card transition had a quality to it where it was like a flat vinyl sleeve or CD case being flipped over, or like the cover-flow carousel of music players like iTunes. It did need some adjustments in CSS to change the visuals though, as initially we felt it was a bit too fast and perhaps uncomfortable to view with the 3D perspective effect.

## CSS Adaptability

Fitting the locations and dates from the APIs into the reverse side of the flip cards without expanding the small images too much looked like a problem though, but we had originally planned to have artist names on the front side anyway, and adding a bit more information from the artists API under the images on the front side was able to fit well. As these were all successful artists, reproducing the look of a gold or platinum record award was an idea in what direction to take it, but perhaps was a step too far for presenting information clearly or being easily adaptable to changes later on.

## Flip Cards

A dark mode toggle was added quite early on, and though it did mean having to consider more combinations of colors for the background, text, cards, and borders, it continued working and did stay all the way through.

## Information Layout

Another thing we attempted to include was a favicon, the tiny image that will be associated with the website on things like a tab or bookmark within a browser that so many websites have. The icon file could be made in the free image manipulation software GIMP. We did get it working during the webpage layout tests, but lost it during the moment of audit as the file was outside of the folder where our HTML template was.

# Development Process

- Created website versions with copied API details for a few artists to learn HTML/CSS and explore visuals.
- Replaced copied details with template tags for the Go server.

# Visual Enhancements

- Explored circular images, making them more appealing.
- Implemented flip card transitions for displaying additional information.
- Made CSS adjustments for a smoother 3D effect.

# Displaying Data

- Integrated locations and dates into flip cards, creatively fitting artist names and more API info on the front side.
- Considered replicating gold/platinum awards, but deemed it impractical for clarity and adaptability.

# User Experience

- Added a dark mode toggle, ensuring a consistent experience with various color combinations.
- Attempted to include a favicon using GIMP, but lost it during an audit due to its placement outside the HTML template folder.

# Project Management

The development process for the Groupie Tracker application was well-structured and organized, enabling the team to efficiently build a functional and visually appealing web application. Here is an overview of the project management aspects:

## Agile Development

The team followed an agile development approach, breaking down the project into smaller tasks and iterations. This allowed for continuous feedback and improvements, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements and implement new features.

## Task Division

Tasks were divided among team members based on their expertise and interests. The team worked on fetching data from APIs, creating a working server, and developing different versions of the website. This approach ensured a collaborative effort and efficient use of resources.

## Learning and Exploration

While working on versions of the website, the team utilized copied API details to learn HTML and CSS, explore visuals, and design the user interface. This hands-on experience was valuable in making informed decisions for the final application.

## Visual Enhancements

The team focused on visual enhancements, such as using circular images and implementing flip card transitions for artist information. This attention to detail made the website more engaging and improved the overall user experience.

## Data Integration

Efforts were made to efficiently integrate data from APIs into the flip cards. By creatively fitting artist names and additional information on the front side, the team ensured a seamless and aesthetically pleasing display of data.

## Dark Mode Toggle

An early addition of the dark mode toggle demonstrated a user-centric approach to design. This feature allowed users to customize the website's appearance and proved to be a successful addition throughout the development process.

## Project Adaptability

The team demonstrated adaptability by replacing copied API details with template tags, making the application more scalable and maintainable in the long run. Decisions were made to prioritize clarity and ease of future updates over replicating complex visual elements.

## Issue Resolution

Throughout development, the team actively addressed issues that arose, such as the inclusion of a favicon. Although the favicon implementation was temporarily lost during an audit, the team's troubleshooting approach ensured continuous progress.

## Team Collaboration

The collaborative effort of the team played a crucial role in the success of the project. Regular communication and shared goals contributed to a smooth workflow and a cohesive final product.

## Continuous Improvement

The project management process embraced continuous improvement. The team welcomed feedback, reviewed each iteration, and iteratively refined the application to meet the intended goals.

By combining effective project management strategies with creative problem-solving and collaborative efforts, the Groupie Tracker application was successfully developed, providing users with an engaging and interactive platform to explore their favorite artists and concert details.
